# WordPress
This is a project to learn WordPress theme development from scratch.

If you have basic PHP skills, and are looking to develop a WordPress theme, then this step by step tutorial is for you. I will cover the basics of building a WordPress theme from scratch. I am assuming you have WordPress installed and running.

From this I am using a html template and converting it's to the wordpress theme.
